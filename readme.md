- I have used Maven instead of Gradle
- Currently search by params will handle only one request parameter
- In the attached postman collection, replace the Bearer token with an active one using "/authenticate" to test the APIs
- Enhancements that can be done in this project :
   ->advance search for all possible combinations can be developed by using CriteriaBuiler
   ->server side pagination and sorting can be implemented
